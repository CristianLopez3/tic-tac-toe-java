            WELCOME TO TIC-TAC-TOE! ü•≥
            RULES:
                1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
                2. You are ‚ùå, your friend (or the computer in this case) is ‚≠ï. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
                3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
                4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
                5. To make a move, enter a number from 1 to 9 to place your mark in the corresponding square.
            Have fun playing! ü´®
